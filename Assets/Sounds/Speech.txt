Hello. I am the one who hired you and the owner of this house. My request from you is to take care of the house for a few days. First, you can start by collecting the garbage outside, and in the evening, visit the house and make sure that there is no one inside. When I come back, if you haven't left, I will give you a large extra paycheck. Also, if you see strange things in the evening, it's probably animals in the forest. take care
